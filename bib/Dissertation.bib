The proposed method can be implemented with other considerations such as substantive information about the items, or expert knowledge about the domain, to produce a more integrative framework of Q-matrix validation. The paper presents the theoretical foundation for the proposed method, develops an algorithm for its practical implementation, and provides real and simulated data applications to examine its viability.

CDMs are developed for the purpose of identifying the mastery or nonmastery of multiple fine-grained attributes or skills required for solving problems in a domain. For CDMs to receive wider use, researchers and practitioners need to understand the basic properties of these models. The article focuses on one CDM, the deterministic inputs, noisy “and” gate (DINA) model, and the invariance property of its parameters. Using simulated data involving different attribute distributions, the article demonstrates that the DINA model parameters are absolutely invariant when the model perfectly fits the data. An additional example involving different ability groups illustrates how noise in real data can contribute to the lack of invariance in these parameters.

Results of the simulation study indicate that the fully Bayes approach is most accurate when the prior distribution matches the latent class structure. However, when the latent classes are of indefinite structure, the empirical Bayes method in conjunction with an unstructured prior distribution provides much better estimates and classification accuracy. Moreover, using empirical Bayes with an unstructured prior does not lead to extremely poor results as other prior-estimation method combinations do. The simulation results also show that increasing the sample size reduces the variability, and to some extent the bias, of item parameter estimates, whereas lower level of guessing and slip parameter is associated with higher quality item parameter estimation and classification accuracy.},

However, the Q-matrix is usually determined by expert judgment, and so there can be uncertainty about some of its elements. Here it is shown that this uncertainty can be recognized and explored via a Bayesian extension of the DINA (deterministic input noisy and) model. The approach used is to specify some elements of the Q-matrix as being random rather than as fixed; posterior distributions can then be used to obtain information about elements whose inclusion in the Q-matrix is questionable. Simulations show that this approach helps to recover the true Q-matrix when there is uncertainty about some elements. An application to the fraction-subtraction data of K. K. Tatsuoka suggests a modified Q-matrix that gives improved relative fit.},

We investigated misspecifications of interaction effect parameters under correct Q-matrix specification and two types of Q-matrix misspecification. While the misspecification of interaction effects had little impact on classification accuracy, invalid Q-matrix specifications led to notably decreased classification accuracy. Two proposed item-fit indexes were more strongly sensitive to overspecification of Q-matrix entries for items than to underspecification. Information-based fit indexes AIC and BIC were sensitive to both over- and underspecification.},

Although these approaches have provided insights into comparisons between countries, they have yet to examine how specific attribute mastery affects student performance and how they can provide information for curricular instruction. In the 2007 administration of TIMSS, two benchmark participants—Massachusetts and Minnesota—were tested following the same procedural methods, providing an opportunity for comparison within and across the United States. Overall comparison of their performance showed Massachusetts and Minnesota to significantly outperform the United States. However, this article shows that there is a greater wealth of fine-grained information that can be translated directly for classroom application at the attribute level when a cognitive diagnostic model (CDM) such as the deterministic, inputs, noisy, “and” gate (Junker \& Sijtsma, 2001) model is used. Results showed a significant disparity between proportions of correctly answering and mastering skills required to solve an item. Advantages of CDMs are discussed as well as a CDM-based method to filter distractor response categories that can aid instructors to diagnose a student's attribute mastery.},

The paper discusses how Bayesian network models are set up with expert information, improved and calibrated from data, and deployed as evidence-based inference engines. Aimed at a general educational measurement audience, the paper illustrates the flexibility and capabilities of Bayesian networks through a series of concrete examples, and without extensive technical detail. Examples are provided of proficiency spaces with direct dependencies among proficiency nodes, and of customized evidence models for complex tasks. This paper is intended to motivate educational measurement practitioners to learn more about Bayesian networks from the research literature, to acquire readily available Bayesian network software, to perform studies with real and simulated data sets, and to look for opportunities in educational settings that may benefit from diagnostic assessment fueled by Bayesian network modeling.},

This report is divided into four sections: The first provides examples of the problems that must be handled by a diagnostic model. It then introduces procedural networks as a general framework for representing the knowledge underlying a skill. The challenge in designing this representation is to find one that facilitates the discovery of misconceptions or bugs existing in a particular student's encoding of this knowledge. The second section discusses some of the pedagogical issues that have emerged from the use of diagnostic models within an instructional system. This discussion is framed in the context of a computer-based tutoring/gaming system developed to teach students and student teachers how to diagnose bugs strategically as well as how to provide a better understanding of the underlying structure of arithmetic skills. The third section describes our uses of an executable network as a tool for automatically diagnosing student behavior, for automatically generating “diagnostic” tests, and for judging the diagnostic quality of a given exam.

that provides a qualitative specification of the item-attribute relationship. In
this paper, we develop theories on the identifiability for the
Q-matrix under the DINA and the DINO models. We further
propose an estimation procedure for the Q-matrix through the
regularized maximum likelihood. The applicability of this procedure is not
limited to the DINA or the DINO model and it can be applied to essentially all
Q-matrix based diagnostic classification models. Simulation
studies are conducted to illustrate its performance. Furthermore, two case
studies are presented. The first case is a data set on fraction subtraction
(educational application) and the second case is a subsample of the National
Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions concerning the social
anxiety disorder (psychiatric application).},

In this study, a Q-matrix for an assessment mapping all 15 possible attribute patterns based on four independent attributes was misspecified by changing one ``0'' or ``1'' for each item. This was done in a way that ensured that certain attribute combinations were completely deleted from the Q-matrix, and certain incorrect dependency relationships between attributes were represented. Results showed clear effects that included an itemspecific overestimation of slipping parameters when attributes were deleted from the Q-matrix, an item-specific overestimation of guessing parameters when attributes were added to the Q-matrix, and high misclassification rates for attribute classes that contained attribute combinations that were deleted from the Q-matrix.},

The method is applied to reading achievement data from a nationally representative sample of fourth-grade students and offers useful perspectives on test structure and examinee ability, distinct from those provided by other methods of analysis. Models fitted to small, overlapping sets of items are integrated into a common skill map, and the nature of each skill is then inferred from the characteristics of the items for which it is required. The reading comprehension items examined conform closely to a unidimensional scale with six discrete skill levels that range from an inability to comprehend or match isolated words in a reading passage to the abilities required to integrate passage content with general knowledge and to recognize the main ideas of the most difficult passages on the test.},

The models considered make few assumptions about the relationship between latent attributes and task performance beyond a simple conjunctive structure. An example shows that these models can be sensitive to cognitive attributes, even in data designed to well fit the Rasch model. Several stochastic ordering and monotonicity properties are considered that enhance the interpretability of the models. Simple data summaries are identified that inform about the presence or absence of cognitive attributes when the full computational power needed to estimate the models is not available.},

This approach results in a parsimonious model for the joint distribution of a high-dimensional attribute vector that is natural in many situations when specific cognitive information is sought but a less informative item response model would be a reasonable alternative. This approach stems from viewing the attributes as the specific knowledge required for examination performance, and modeling these attributes as arising from a broadly-defined latent trait resembling theϑ of item response models. In this way a relatively simple model for the joint distribution of the attributes results, which is based on a plausible model for the relationship between general aptitude and specific knowledge. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for parameter estimation are given for selected response distributions, and simulation results are presented to examine the performance of the algorithm as well as the sensitivity of classification to model misspecification.

Having emanated from educational measurement, several aspects of such models seem well suited to use in psychological assessment and diagnosis. This article presents the development of a new cognitive diagnosis model for use in psychological assessment--the DINO (deterministic input; noisy "or" gate) model--which, as an illustrative example, is applied to evaluate and diagnose pathological gamblers. As part of this example, a demonstration of the estimates obtained by cognitive diagnosis models is provided. Such estimates include the probability an individual meets each of a set of dichotomous Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (text revision [DSM-IV-TR]; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria, resulting in an estimate of the probability an individual meets the DSM-IV-TR definition for being a pathological gambler. Furthermore, a demonstration of how the hypothesized underlying factors contributing to pathological gambling can be measured with the DINO model is presented, through use of a covariance structure model for the tetrachoric correlation matrix of the dichotomous latent variables representing DSM-IV-TR criteria.},

The objective of each of these models is to classify examinees according to their mastery of skills assumed to be required for fraction subtraction. We consider the DINA model, the NIDA model, and a new model that extends the DINA model to allow for multiple strategies of problem solving. For each of these models the joint distribution of the indicators of skill mastery is modeled using a single continuous higher-order latent trait, to explain the dependence in the mastery of distinct skills. This approach stems from viewing the skills as the specific states of knowledge required for exam performance, and viewing these skills as arising from a broadly defined latent trait resembling the θ of item response models. We discuss several techniques for comparing models and assessing goodness of fit. We then implement these methods using the fraction subtraction data with the aim of selecting the best of the three models for this application. We employ Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to fit the models, and we present simulation results to examine the performance of these algorithms.},

Using a sample English test of three grammatical skills, we describe how diagnostic classification models can be phrased as latent class models within Mplus and how to obtain the syntax and output needed for estimation and interpretation of the model parameters. We also have written a freely available SAS program that can be used to automatically generate the Mplus syntax.

Specifically, this module describes the vocabulary used in simulations, reviews their applications in recent literature, and recommends specific guidelines for designing simulation studies and presenting results. Additionally, an example (including computer code in R) is given to demonstrate how common aspects of simulation studies can be implemented in practice and to provide a template to help users build their own simulation.},

Pattern-level classification consistency and accuracy indices were introduced by Cui, Gierl, and Chang. However, the indices at the attribute level have not yet been constructed. This study puts forward a simple approach to estimating the indices at both the attribute and the pattern level through one single test administration. Detailed elaboration is made on how the upper and lower bounds for the attribute-level accuracy can be derived from the variance of error of the attribute mastery probability estimate. In addition, based on Cui's pattern-level indices, an alternative approach to estimating the attribute-level indices is also proposed. Comparative analysis of simulation results indicate that the new indices are very desirable for evaluating test-retest consistency and correct classification rate.},

Although many DIF assessment methods have been developed in the context of classical test theory and item response theory, they are not applicable for cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs), as the underlying latent attributes of CDMs are multidimensional and binary. This study proposes a very general DIF assessment method in the CDM framework which is applicable for various CDMs, more than two groups of examinees, and multiple grouping variables that are categorical, continuous, observed, or latent. The parameters can be estimated with Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms implemented in the freeware WinBUGS. Simulation results demonstrated a good parameter recovery and advantages in DIF assessment for the new method over the Wald method.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.
